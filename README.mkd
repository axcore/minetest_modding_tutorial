This tutorial is designed for anyone who wants to have a go at writing a simple [Minetest](https://www.minetest.net/) mod.

You don't need to know anything about programming languages, because we will cover that.

You *will* need some basic computer skills. If you know how to open and close files and folders, how to move files from one place to another, and how to use a simple graphics application like [Microsoft Paint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_paint), then this tutorial is for you!  

If you already have some coding experience, or if you have elaborate plans for a Minetest mod, then you should ignore this tutorial and read [rubenwardy's modding book](https://rubenwardy.com/minetest_modding_book/en/index.html) instead.

We cover quite a lot of topics. Everyone should read Chapters 1-3. After that, you can read whichever chapters interest you.
