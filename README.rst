------------------------

This tutorial is designed for anyone who wants to have a go at writing a simple `Minetest <https://www.minetest.net/>`__ mod.

You don't need to know anything about programming languages, because we will cover that.

You will need some basic computer skills. If you know how to open and close files and folders, how to move files from one place to another, and how to use a simple graphics application like Microsoft Paint, then this tutorial is for you!

If you already have some coding experience, or if you have elaborate plans for a Minetest mod, then you should ignore this tutorial and read `rubenwardy's modding book <https://rubenwardy.com/minetest_modding_book/en/index.html>`__ instead.

We cover quite a lot of topics. Everyone should read Chapters 1-3. After that, you can read whichever chapters interest you. 

If you are reading this on Github, you need to **download the tutorial**, and then open **index.html** in your web browser.
