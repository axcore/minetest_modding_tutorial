<h1>5 Craftitems</h1>
<p>We can think of a craftitems as something that can be held, but not placed on the ground (at least, not without some special code). You have probably picked apples from a tree, and picked blueberries from a bush. Apples and blueberries are both craftitems.</p>
<hr>
<p>Creating new craftitems is simple. Let's create a chocolate bar that you can eat. As before, create your own image, or use this one:</p>
<p><img alt="Chocolate bar" src="img/ch05/hello_chocolate.png"></p>
<p>This image contains transparent pixels, so that the chocolate bar has the right shape. If you're not sure how that is done in your graphics application, either search for help, or just use a normal square image.</p>
<p>Copy the image into your mod's <strong>textures</strong> folder before continuing.</p>
<hr>
<p>We start with another new function that receives two pieces of data.</p>
<pre><code>    minetest.register_craftitem(NAME, TABLE)
</code></pre>
<p>A good name for your craftitem would be <strong>hello:chocolate</strong>, so let's add that, and split the table across separate lines.</p>
<pre><code>    minetest.register_craftitem("hello:chocolate", {
        STUFF
        GOES
        HERE
    })
</code></pre>
<p>For craftitems, the table almost always contains a <strong>description</strong> and an <strong>inventory_image</strong>. The craftitem is flat, so only one image is needed; we don't have to think about lists.</p>
<pre><code>    minetest.register_craftitem("hello:chocolate", {
        description = "Delicious Chocolate Bar",
        inventory_image = "hello_chocolate.png",
    })
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>Now, let's talk about <strong>callbacks</strong>.</p>
<p>Much of your Lua code sits around, doing nothing, until it's actually needed. In this case, the chocolate sits in your inventory, doing nothing, until you try to eat it.</p>
<p>In most cases, eating something should improve the player's health, so we need a function that takes care of that.</p>
<p>Having written the function, we ask Minetest to "call us back" whenever the player tries to <strong>use</strong> the chocolate. When the callback is received, the function is executed.</p>
<p>This type of <strong>callback</strong> is in the following format:</p>
<pre><code>    on_use = FUNCTION,
</code></pre>
<p>Whenever our code receives the callback, it checks to see whether <strong>on_use</strong> exists in the table. If so, the function is called (and something happens). If not, nothing happens.</p>
<p>Here is the complete code, which you can add to your <strong>init.lua</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>    minetest.register_craftitem("hello:chocolate", {
        description = "Delicious Chocolate Bar",
        inventory_image = "hello_chocolate.png",
        on_use = minetest.item_eat(2),
    })
</code></pre>
<p>Whenever you want to create something edible, just copy and paste the <strong>on_use</strong> line. If you like, you can change the number. In <a href="https://content.minetest.net/packages/Minetest/minetest_game/">minetest-game</a>, the value 2 increases the player's health by one heart. The value 4 would increase it by 2 hearts.  </p>
<p>Since this is a chocolate bar, and not something healthy, you might try using a negative number. Modify the code to use the value <strong>-2</strong> and see what happens!</p>
